#### Metrics Collection

- Various metrics related to the registrations, offerings selected by candidates, progress of the candidates, and so on can be tracked.
These metrics are pushed to prometheus periodically.

#### Metrics Visualisation
- Grafana is a very powerful visualisation tool that can be used to visualise the metrics in the form of grpahs, pie charts, etc. in order to extract meaningful insights into the usage patterns of the system.
- Grafana can also be configured to extract infrastructure metrics such as CPU, memory, from the K8 clusters, to monitor resource utilisation.
