# The Spotlight App Project - Illuminate Possibilities

## Introduction
Diversity Cyber Council is a 501c3 Non-Profit that serves under-represented demographics in the tech industry by facilitating education, training, and staffing opportunities to establish a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline to the workforce. Their vision is to enhance inclusion and representation in the tech industry through training, mentoring, networking, and visibility programs. Their goal is to establish a sustainable and diverse talent pipeline that extends career equity to under-represented demographics by providing access to competent training programs that lead to direct employment opportunities. 

### The Spotlight App Project
The Spotlight App Project is a sustained effort to amass a coalition of nonprofits in order to address specific needs within the communities, by leveraging a centralized platform as the base of operations to collaborate and make a collective impact. 

The project aims to solve two problems: 
1. The decentralization and lack of support between nonprofits create gaps of service and overall impact. 												
2. The lack of visibility of nonprofit groups and offerings creates a barrier of access to the people we aim to serve. 

This architecture document aims at providing a technology solution that serves the purpose of enhancing visibility, support, and collaboration of nonprofits serving similar needs in the community and operates as a candidate case management platform.
