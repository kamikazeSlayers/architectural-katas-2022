## Assumptions

1. Platform will need to ensure a minimum number of mentors and community leaders based on the number of candidates and NPOs.
2. There would be an upper cap on the number of people that a person can mentor.
3. Community is a separate entity always associated with a forum.
4. An NPO can be a part of multiple communities.
5. Community leaders are already part of the platform who are proficient in certain skill sets (services).
6. There will be a default community that an NPO is assigned to before it is assigned to a community that suits its services and offerings by a community leader
7. Platform will match the community leader to a NPO based on the services, location etc. 
8. If there is a new service, broadcast the community leader election request among "n" community leaders. If the request is not accepted, then we fall back to platform admin.
9. One user can have multiple roles (NP, Candidate ...)
10. Community leader must verify authenticity of NP and approve.
11. Meetings can be physical or virtual. In case of virtual meetings, the platform will rely on third-party services/applications like Google Meet, Zoom etc.
12. Posts in a community forum can contain text and one or more images upto 10 MB.

## Constraints

1. Cost is a contraint. The solution must be cost effective since it is for use by non profit organisations.
2. Candidates who avail the services do not pay for them
3. The platform should be supported on both mobile and desktop devices.
4. The platform should support any browser type like google chrome, mozilla firefox, IE, Safari, etc.
5. The UI should be simple and intuitive
6. NPO offerings only include rich text, links, downloadable reading content eg. PDF. No videos and music formats are supported. 
7. The app should be accessible to all diverse kinds of users.
