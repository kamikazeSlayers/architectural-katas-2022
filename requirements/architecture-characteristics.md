# Architecture Characteristics
In this document, we list the architecture characteristics that we considered important for the system.

## Availability
The system must be highly available and strive for atleast 99.9% ("two nines") availability. This translates to around 8.77 hours of downtime in a year. Even during downtime, the system should handle failures gracefully and not compromise on the end-user's experience.

## Security
The system should be secure and not risk any leakage of personal identifiable information (PII). The third party authorization providers should be carefully considered and provide necessary support when and if required.

## Scalability
The system should scale as per the requirements. The SaaS providers should provide support for scaling the system up and down based on key metrics, namely CPU utilization, requests per second (RPS), memory consumption.

## Performance

All interactions with the candidates and non-profit actors must be timely to provide a smooth experience. This means less than a second for most operations. All other (admin-related) interactions should be responsive enough to support operations, but itâ€™s acceptable to be less responsive than the end-user interactions.

## Cost Effectiveness
Resources, technologies, and infrastructure required to create the platform must be cost effective since it is used by non profit organisations. Wherever applicable, open source solutions can be considered as they are cost-effective.

## Maintainability
The sytem must be easy to maintain when it comes to deploying new features, bug fixes or patching infrastructure with software upgrades and security vulnerabilites. There should not be any downtime associated with these activities.

## Mapping of Non Functional Requirements to Architecture Characteristics
The following table lists the NFRs that we considered and maps them to relevant architecture characteristics:
| S. No. | Description | Architecture Characteristic |
|:---:|---|:---:|
| 1 | The user should be able to navigate the system with ease with prompts where necessary and a complete user guide to be able to use the app without any training or assistance | Usability |
| 2 | Searching for Non profits, offerings, candidates must be made possible including typos in the search fields | Usability |
| 3 | Assume total users in the system are around 1,000,000 (NPOs and candidates), active users are 10% of the total users and concurrent users are 10% of the active users (as per [widely accepted rule of thumb](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cognos-analytics/10.2.2?topic=SSEP7J_10.2.2/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.crn_arch.10.2.2.doc/c_arch_estimatingconcurrentusers.html)). We get 100,000 active users with 10,000 users online. <br/> Considering 10 rpm for any user interacting with the system, the platform must support 100K rpm. | Scalability |
| 4 | Assume 1 offering/service includes files and downloadables worth 100MB. If 1 NGO supports upto 10 offerings, each NGO would need 1GB data. For initial 100 NGOs, we would need upto 100GB storage. If 10 NGOs are added per month, storage requirements increase by 10GB per month. In order to support upto 1000 NGOs over a period of 10 years, we need to be able to support upto 1TB storage. | Scalability |
| 5 | New entity updates must be discoverable / searchable within 10 seconds | Performance |
| 6 | Search results must be made available within 2 seconds | Performance |
| 7 | All front end pages must load within 5 seconds | Performance |
| 8 | The platform must be available at all times except during maintenance activities. Target availability 99.9% of the time | Availability |
| 9 | The candidates and NPOs must only be able to view their own reports and metrics. Reports and metrics / data related to other candidates and NPOs must be restricted | Security |
| 10 | The system must be modular and support reusability of components and resources where possible | Maintainability |
| 11 | Regular upgrades to the infrastructure is performed to keep the dependencies and the system up to date with bug fixes, vulnerabilities, etc with minimal downtime | Maintainability |
| 12 | Resources, technologies, and infrastructure required to create the platform must be cost effective since it is used by non-profit organisations | Cost Effectiveness |
